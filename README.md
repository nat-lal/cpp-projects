BigInt: 
Calculator written in C++ that can do addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentiation, and modular exponentiation with numbers of any size. It can perform these calculations on numbers from any base between 2 and 36 using a custom BigInteger class.
Long multiplication and division have O(n^2) runtime, exponentiation uses squaring with an O(logn) runtime.
